To run the script, simply place the “ec833_project2.py” file in the same directory as the training and test sets. 

The script expects the training data to be contained in a folder named “train”. Likewise, it expects the test data to be contained in a folder named “test”. Keep the "lambdaloader"
and "dataloader" files in the same directory as well.

For any questions on how to run or adapt the script, please reach Eduardo Joaquin Castillo at 856-676-2891 or ec833@cornell.edu.
